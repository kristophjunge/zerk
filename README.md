##About

Zerk is a JavaScript game engine prototype developed by Kristoph Junge. 

Zerk aims to be able to run various types of 2D games on desktop and mobile devices.

It uses [Box2DWeb](http://code.google.com/p/box2dweb/) a JavaScript port of the [Box2D](http://box2d.org/) physics library written by Erin Catto.


##Using Zerk

Zerk is currently at an early development stage, use it at your own risk.
